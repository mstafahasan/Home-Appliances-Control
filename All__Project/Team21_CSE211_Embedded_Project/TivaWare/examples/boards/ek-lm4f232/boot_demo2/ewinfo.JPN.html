Boot Loader Demo 2

An example to demonstrate the use of a flash-based boot loader.  At startup,
the application will configure the UART, USB and Ethernet peripherals, wait
for a widget on the screen to be pressed, and then branch to the boot
loader to await the start of an update.  If using the serial boot loader
(boot_serial), the UART will always be configured at 115,200 baud and does
not require the use of auto-bauding.

This application is intended for use with any of the three flash-based boot
loader flavors (boot_eth, boot_serial or boot_usb) included in the software
release.  To accommodate the largest of these (boot_usb), the link address
is set to 0x2800.  If you are using serial or Ethernet boot loader, you
may change this address to a 1KB boundary higher than the last address
occupied by the boot loader binary as long as you also rebuild the boot 
loader itself after modifying its bl_config.h file to set APP_START_ADDRESS
to the same value.

The boot_demo1 application can be used along with this application to 
easily demonstrate that the boot loader is actually updating the on-chip
flash.

Note that the LM4F232 and other Blizzard-class devices also the
support serial and USB boot loaders in ROM.  To make use of this
function, link your application to run at address 0x0000 in flash and enter
the bootloader using either the ROM_UpdateUSB or ROM_UpdateSerial
functions (defined in rom.h).  This mechanism is used in the
utils/swupdate.c module when built specifically targeting a suitable
Blizzard-class device.
