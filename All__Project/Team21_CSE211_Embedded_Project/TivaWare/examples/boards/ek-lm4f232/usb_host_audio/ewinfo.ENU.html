USB host audio example application using SD Card FAT file system


This example application demonstrates playing .wav files from an SD card
that is formatted with a FAT file system using USB host audio class.  The
application will only look in the root directory of the SD card and display
all files that are found.  Files can be selected to show their format and
then played if the application determines that they are a valid .wav file.
Only PCM format (uncompressed) files may be played.

For additional details about FatFs, see the following site:
