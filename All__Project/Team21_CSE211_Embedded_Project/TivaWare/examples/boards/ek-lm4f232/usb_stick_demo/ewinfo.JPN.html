USB Stick Update Demo

An example to demonstrate the use of the flash-based USB stick update
program.  This example is meant to be loaded into flash memory from a USB
memory stick, using the USB stick update program (usb_stick_update),
running on the microcontroller.

After this program is built, the binary file (usb_stick_demo.bin), should
be renamed to the filename expected by usb_stick_update ("FIRMWARE.BIN" by
default) and copied to the root directory of a USB memory stick.  Then,
when the memory stick is plugged into the eval board that is running the
usb_stick_update program, this example program will be loaded into flash
and then run on the microcontroller.

This program simply displays a message on the screen and prompts the user
to press the select button.  Once the button is pressed, control is passed
back to the usb_stick_update program which is still is flash, and it will
attempt to load another program from the memory stick.  This shows how
a user application can force a new firmware update from the memory stick.
