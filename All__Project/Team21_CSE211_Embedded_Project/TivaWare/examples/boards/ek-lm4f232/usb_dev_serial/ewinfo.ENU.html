USB Serial Device

This example application turns the evaluation kit into a virtual serial
port when connected to the USB host system.  The application supports the
USB Communication Device Class, Abstract Control Model to redirect UART0
traffic to and from the USB host system.

Assuming you installed TivaWare in the default directory, a
driver information (INF) file for use with Windows XP, Windows Vista and
Windows7 can be found in C:/ti/TivaWare-for-C-Series/windows_drivers.
For Windows 2000, the required INF file is in
C:/ti/TivaWare-for-C-Series/windows_drivers/win2K.
